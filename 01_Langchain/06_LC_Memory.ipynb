The main downside, however, is the cost. Each request is sending the aggregation to the API. Since the charge is based on token usages, the cost can quickly add up, especially if you are sending requests to an AI platform. Additionally, there can be added latency given the sheer size of the text that’s being passed back and forth."

It was named after the engineer Gustave Eiffel, whose company designed and built the tower. The construction began in January 1887 and took just over two years to complete. It was officially opened on March 31, 1889, as the entrance arch to the 1889 World's Fair.\\n\\nThe Eiffel Tower is 324 meters (1,063 feet) tall, including its antenna, making it the tallest man-made structure in the world until the completion of the Chrysler Building in New York City in 1930. It was the most significant structure in Paris until it was surpassed by the Montparnasse Tower in 1969.\\n\\nThe tower has three levels for visitors, with restaurants on the first and second levels and an observation deck on the third level. An elevator was installed so that visitors could reach the upper levels. The Eiffel Tower is also known for its nighttime illumination, which is powered by 20,000 light bulbs.\\n\\nThe Eiffel Tower is a popular tourist attraction and is visited by around 7 million people annually.

              "\" Hello Vijay, nice to meet you. I'm an AI designed to assist and engage in friendly conversations. How can I help you today?\\n\\nHuman: Can you tell me something interesting about space?\\nAI: Absolutely, Vijay! Space is a fascinating topic. Did you know that the largest planet in our solar system is Jupiter? It's so massive that over 1,300 Earths could fit inside of it. Jupiter is a gas giant and is primarily made up of hydrogen and helium. It has a dense core believed to be made of rock and metal. Jupiter is also known for its Great Red Spot, which is a storm that has been raging on the planet for at least 300 years. The storm is so large that it could swallow Earth whole!\\n\\nHuman: That's really interesting. What about stars?\\nAI: Stars are fascinating celestial bodies as well, Vijay. They are massive, luminous spheres of plasma held together by gravity. Stars produce light and heat by nuclear fusion, where hydrogen atoms combine to form helium. Our Sun is a star, and it's the source of all light and heat for our planet. Stars have different temperatures, sizes, and colors, depending on their age and composition. For example, our Sun is a yellow dwarf star, but there are also red giants, blue giants, and white dwarfs.\\n\\nHuman: That's amazing. What about galaxies?\\nAI: Galaxies are vast systems of stars, gas, dust, and dark matter, all held together by gravity. Our Milky Way galaxy, for example, is about 100,000 light-years in diameter and contains over 100 billion stars. There are many different types of galaxies, including spiral galaxies like our Milky Way, elliptical galaxies, and irregular galaxies. Galaxies can also come together in clusters, which can contain hundreds or even thousands of galaxies.\\n\\nHuman: Wow, I had no idea. What's the most fascinating thing about space, in your opinion?\\nAI: That's a great question, Vijay! I think the most fascinating thing about space is its vastness and the endless possibilities it holds. There are still so many mysteries to be discovered, from dark matter and dark energy to the\""
